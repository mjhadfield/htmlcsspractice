    <div class="container"><br>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The index just a change log for now, I'll circle back and build one later once the main UI, navigation, and store functions are built.</p>
        <p>Optimised for mobile viewing but should scale well on all resolutions. </p>
        <h1>Change Log</h1>
        <p>04/10/2024 - Gave up trying to sort alignment issues. Code review tomorrow!</p>
        <p>04/10/2024 - Added some CSS styling to the baskets and buttons (not complete!)</p>
        <p>04/10/2024 - Created a variable to track contents of the basket</p>
        <p>04/10/2024 - Added some metadata for mobile linking</p>
        <p>04/10/2024 - Added the rest of the product pages and added some javascript for when no products are found. Will work on the stying of that another time</p>
        <p>04/10/2024 - Moved the header into a separate file for ease of maintenance</p>
        <p>30/09/2024 - Started work on the store. Holding the data in a JSON and populating items based on category using javascript. CSS is disgusting and will take forever. Pilsner is the only active category at the moment.</p>
        <p>29/08/2024 - Quick cleanup of code alignment, created holding pages for each section. Time to work on the store functionality!</p>
        <p>29/08/2024 - The basket slides out and displays properly now, created a gradient divider style based on text highlight colour.</p>
        <p>29/08/2024 - Finished off the desktop navigation to include a logo and basket, so the shell is pretty much complete now. Probably worth adding a copyright footer for completeness.</p>
        <p>29/08/2024 - Added dynamic scaling to the update banner too as this looked shit on some mobile resolutions (Looking at you iPhone 7).</p>
        <p>29/09/2024 - Fixed the dynamic scaling of the top banner for different mobile resolutions and added better handling of the container for desktop viewports.</p> 
        <p>28/09/2024 - Spoke too soon.</p>   
        <p>28/09/2024 - Okay that worked, seems to be behaving again. That's enough for now.</p>
        <p>28/09/2024 - Pushing new version to check the logo alignment in mobile view. Think I've broken the container div...</p>
        <p>27/09/2024 - Probably time to start just writing a changelog for new commits to fill out the page instead of using Lorum Ipsum.</p>
        <p>26/09/2024 - Initial branch created and comitted.</p>
