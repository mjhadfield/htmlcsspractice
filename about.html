        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This website is my attempt to get comfortable with Visual Studio Code, Git version control, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's hosted on GitHub and the full source code is available <a href="https://github.com/mjhadfield/htmlcsspractice">here</a></p>
        <p>Because it's on GitHub it's statis and there's no ability for databases or server-side storage, but on the plus side, it's copletely free.</p>
        <p>I've tried my best to keep the code organised and readable, but it's inefficient and clunky. My class names are all over the place and the bulk of the javascript is AI generated. <br><br> There are definitely better ways to do almost everything, but if it's stupid and it works then it's not stupid.</p>
