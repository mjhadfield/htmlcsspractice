        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This website is my attempt to get comfortable with Visual Studio Code, Git version control, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's hosted on GitHub and the <a href="https://github.com/mjhadfield/htmlcsspractice">full source code is available here</a></p>
        <p>Because it's on GitHub, it's static website with no databases or server-side storage. I'm also not using any frameworks, so everything is pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I've tried my best to keep the code organised and readable, but it's inefficient and clunky. My class names are all over the place and the JavaScript is a hot mess.</p>
        <p>There are definitely better ways to do almost everything, but if it's stupid and it works then it's not stupid.</p>
